DESCRIPTION
    For detailed information see Business::OnlinePayment.

API
    "load_config()"
        loads "cybs.ini"

    "map_fields"
    "request_merge"
    "set_defaults"

SUPPORTED TRANSACTION TYPES
  Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover
    Content required: type, login, action, amount, first_name, last_name,
    card_number, expiration.

  Checks
    Currently not supported (TODO)

NOTE
  cybs.ini
    The cybs.ini default home is /etc/cybs.ini - if you would prefer it to
    live someplace else specify that in the new.

    A few notes on cybs.ini - most settings can be overwritten by the submit
    call - except for the following exceptions:

      sendToProduction

    From a systems perspective, this should be hard so that there is NO
    confusion as to which server the request goes against.

    You can set the business rules from the ini - the following rules are
    supported

      businessRules_declineAVSFlags

      businessRules_ignoreAVSResult

      businessRules_ignoreCVResult

  Full Name vs. First & Last
    Unlike Business::OnlinePayment, Business::OnlinePayment::CyberSource
    requires separate first_name and last_name fields. I should probably
    Just split them apart. If you feel industrious...

  Settling
    To settle an authorization-only transaction (where you set action to
    'Authorization Only'), submit the request ID code in the field
    "order_number" with the action set to "Post Authorization".

    You can get the transaction id from the authorization by calling the
    order_number method on the object returned from the authorization. You
    must also submit the amount field with a value less than or equal to the
    amount specified in the original authorization.

  Items
    Item fields map as follows:

    *   productCode -> type

        (adult_content, coupon, default, electronic_good,
        electronic_software, gift_certificate, handling_only, service,
        shipping_and_handling, shipping_only, stored_value, subscription)

    *   productSKU -> SKU

    *   productName -> name

    *   quantity -> quantity

    *   taxAmount -> tax

    *   unitPrice -> unit_price

    See the Cybersource documentation for the significance of these fields
    (type can be confusing)

COMPATIBILITY
    This module implements the Simple Order API 1.x from Cybersource.

THANK YOU
    Jason Kohles
        For writing BOP - I didn't have to create my own framework.

    Ivan Kohler
        Tested the first pre-release version and fixed a number of bugs. He
        also encouraged me to add better error reporting for system errors.
        He also added failure_status support.
